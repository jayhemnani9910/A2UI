## Unreleased

- `formatDate` handles TR35 quoted literals (`'at'`, `''` for an apostrophe) and the `EE`/`EEE` weekday widths, matching the web engine.
- Execute `functionCall` and `call` component actions locally in `GenericBinder` and prevent `SurfaceModel.dispatch_action` from emitting them as agent-facing `on_action` events.
- `ExpressionParser` accepts number literals with a leading decimal point
  (`.5`, `-.5`, `+.5`, `.5e2`), including as function-call arguments. `.foo`
  and `./x` are still paths.
- `ExpressionParser` raises `A2uiExpressionError` for a number literal outside
  the double range, such as `1e999` or a 400-digit integer. It used to return
  `inf` for float literals and an exact `int` for integer literals. Integer
  literals longer than 4,300 digits no longer raise a bare `ValueError`.
- **BREAKING**: Optional JSON Schema `default` annotations in generated v0.9
  and v1.0 Pydantic models are kept in field descriptions instead of becoming
  field values. `const` values remain fixed.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-28)

- **BREAKING**: Module paths and validation interfaces moved or changed in v0.2.0. Deprecation shims are provided for renamed public module paths; importing them emits a `DeprecationWarning` naming the new path. These shims will be removed in `v0.3.0`.

  **Shimmed Modules (Deprecated; removal in v0.3.0):**

  | Old Path (`v0.1.x`)                                                                  | New Path (`v0.2.0`)                                                                       | Notes                                                |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | `a2ui.core.basic_catalog.{components,function_apis,function_impls,styles}`           | `a2ui.core.basic_catalog.v0_9.{components,function_apis,function_impls,styles}`           | Re-exports v0.9 basic catalog symbols                |
  | `a2ui.core.basic_catalog.expression_parser`                                          | `a2ui.core.expressions.expression_parser`                                                 | Re-exports `ExpressionParser`, `Scanner`, and limits |
  | `a2ui.core.schema.{client_capabilities,client_to_server,constants,server_to_client}` | `a2ui.core.schema.v0_9.{client_capabilities,client_to_server,constants,server_to_client}` | Also aliases `A2uiClientError*` and `SPEC_VERSION*`  |

  **Unshimmed Internal Modules & Renames:**

  Internal modules were moved without shims; callers should import from the new paths directly:

  - `a2ui.core.rendering` (and `.component_context`, `.data_context`, `.generic_binder`): moved to `a2ui.core.resolution` (and matching submodules).
  - `a2ui.core.validating` (and `.integrity_checker`, `.topology_analyzer`): moved to `a2ui.core.validation` (and `a2ui.core.state.validation_helpers`).
  - `validate_component_integrity`: moved to `a2ui.core.validation` as `(components: dict[str, ComponentModel], root_id: str = ROOT_ID, config: ValidationConfig | None = None) -> None`.
  - `analyze_topology`: moved to `a2ui.core.validation` as `(components: dict[str, ComponentModel], root_id: str = ROOT_ID, config: ValidationConfig | None = None) -> set[str]`.

  **Removed Modules and APIs:**

  | Removed (`v0.1.x`)                                                                               | Replacement (`v0.2.0`)                                                             |

- **BREAKING**: `DataModel` stores data values by reference instead of making deep copies. Callers that mutate nested objects after setting them in `DataModel` will update internal state directly.
- **BREAKING**: `A2uiRpcError` argument order is now `(message, code, ...)`.
- **BREAKING**: `DataModel.set` now raises `A2uiDataError` instead of resetting the root when attempting to traverse or set a subpath under a primitive root value.
- **BREAKING**: `SurfaceComponentsModel.add_component` now raises `A2uiStateError` if a component with the same ID already exists in the model.
- **BREAKING**: pending RPC requests on `RpcHandler.dispose()` are now rejected with error code `CANCELLED` (previously `DISPOSED`).
- `SurfaceModel` now accepts a `root_id` parameter (defaulting to `"root"`) and provides a deprecated `catalog` property aliasing `default_catalog`.
- `SurfaceComponentsModel.detect_cycles` now correctly ignores disconnected orphan components by passing `allow_orphan_components=True` to topology analysis, reporting cycle and depth limit violations exclusively.
- Bound function calls to `MAX_FUNCTION_CALL_ARGS` (1,000 arguments) across both `PayloadValidator.validate_function` and runtime `DataContext._execute_function` resolution.
- Bound expression template strings to `MAX_EXPRESSION_TEMPLATE_LENGTH` (10,000 characters) and parsed expression segments to `MAX_EXPRESSION_PARTS` (1,000 parts) in `ExpressionParser`.
- Add SemVer parsing and comparison utilities (`SemVer`, `compare_semver`, `is_at_least_version`, `normalize_version_string`, `parse_semver`, `to_canonical_version`, `to_semver`) in `a2ui.core.common.semver`.
- Add `A2uiProtocolVersion` and `ProtocolVersion` enum in `a2ui.core.schema`.
- Remove `A2uiCompileError` from `a2ui_core` exception hierarchy.
- **BREAKING**: locale formatting now comes from CLDR by way of `babel`,
  replacing the hand-rolled locale tables. Currency, number, date month and
  weekday names, and plural category selection now match what the TypeScript
  engine gets from `Intl`. That was the point: the two engines previously
  disagreed for every locale other than `en-US`, on the symbol chosen and on
  which Unicode space separates it from the amount.

  `a2ui.core.basic_catalog` no longer exports `LocaleFormattingRules`,
  `register_locale_rules`, `get_locale_rules` or `CURRENCY_SYMBOLS`, and
  `locale_config.py` is deleted. `register_locale_rules` was the extension
  point for registering a custom locale; that capability goes away rather than
  moving, because `babel` resolves locales from CLDR only.

  `babel` is added as a runtime dependency.

  `babel` reads its patterns and symbols from CLDR but does not implement
  CLDR's `currencySpacing`, which ICU does apply. The package supplies that
  rule itself, so a currency whose symbol is alphabetic is separated from the
  amount by U+00A0 as `Intl` separates it: `CHF 1,234.56`, not `CHF1,234.56`.
  This affects the assigned codes `CHF`, `SEK`, `DKK`, `CZK` and `PLN` among
  others, in `en-US` as well as elsewhere.

  One difference from `Intl` remains. For Arabic locales such as `ar-EG`,
  `Intl` shapes digits in Eastern Arabic numerals while `babel` emits Latin
  ones. `babel` offers no way to close this: requesting the locale's default
  numbering system converts the separators but not the digits, which agrees
  with neither engine.

  A locale tag the catalog cannot use falls back to `en_US` rather than
  raising. `babel` raises for a malformed tag and for a well-formed tag CLDR
  does not carry, such as `xx-YY`, either of which would otherwise abort every
  format call made by a catalog built with it. The TypeScript engine falls back
  for the same tags.

- **BREAKING**: the `Dynamic*` schema aliases no longer coerce a value of the
  wrong primitive type. Each admits one primitive type, a data binding, or a
  function call, matching the TypeScript engine and the specification. What
  changes in practice:
  - `DynamicNumber` rejects the string `"1"`, which previously validated as
    `1.0`, and rejects `True`, which previously validated as `1`.
  - `DynamicBoolean` rejects `1`, `0` and `"true"`, which previously validated
    as `True`, `False` and `True`.
  - `DynamicValue` keeps an integer as an integer. It admitted `float` but not
    `int`, so a payload carrying `1` came back as `1.0`.
  - `DynamicString` and `DynamicStringList` are now declared strict for
    consistency. This is not a behaviour change: pydantic already refused to
    coerce other primitives into a string.

  Data bindings and function calls are unaffected.

- The v0.9 and v1.0 basic catalogs no longer register `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`,
  `divide`, `equals`, `not_equals`, `greater_than`, `less_than`, `contains`,
  `starts_with` or `ends_with`. The published catalogs declare exactly 14
  functions, and none of these operators is among them, so an agent had no way to know
  they were callable. `a2ui.core.basic_catalog` no longer exports their
  API classes or implementations, aligning Python engine behavior with the
  reference typescript implementation.

- The v1.0 `formatDate` `ISO` pattern now returns the UTC instant with exactly
  three fractional digits, as `web_core` does. It previously echoed back
  whichever offset the input carried, so `2025-01-01T12:00:00+02:00` formatted
  as itself instead of `2025-01-01T10:00:00.000Z`. A timestamp without an
  offset is read as UTC, so the result no longer depends on the host time zone.

- The v1.0 `pluralize` function now falls back to the `other` form only when
  the selected category is absent, not when its value is empty. A caller that
  supplies `zero: ""` gets an empty string, matching `web_core`; previously the
  empty form was discarded and the `other` form rendered in its place.

- `ExpressionParser.MAX_DEPTH` is 100, up from 10, matching `web_core` and the
  Swift engine. An expression nested between 11 and 100 levels deep was
  rejected here and accepted there.

- A function-call argument now counts toward the expression parser's recursion
  depth, as it does in `web_core`. Only nested interpolations were counted
  before, so `${f(a: ${f(a: ...)})}` written as `${f(a: f(a: ...))}` recursed
  unchecked and raised `RecursionError` from the interpreter rather than a
  parse error.

- `Catalog.from_json` accepts a `common_types_schema` argument and rewrites
  cross-document references such as `common_types.json#/$defs/ChildList` into
  local `#/$defs/...` pointers, satisfying them from the supplied document or
  from the built-in definitions. Catalogs that reference the published shared
  types now load without the `specification/` tree on disk, and the validator
  no longer reads schema files at runtime.
- Deleting a list index past the end of the list is now a no-op. It previously
  padded the list with `None` up to that index, so deleting `/items/10` from a
  three-element list produced an eleven-element list.
- The shared type definitions used to satisfy `common_types.json` references
  are now checked against the published document by a test, with an explicit
  list of the definitions that intentionally differ. Descriptions on
  `AccessibilityAttributes`, `DynamicString`, `DynamicNumber` and
  `DynamicBoolean` were brought back into line with the specification.
- The conformance harness now fails, rather than silently skipping, when a
  suite cannot be parsed, when a case has no `name` or `action`, or when an
  action has no handler. Suites the core library cannot run are named in
  `UNRUNNABLE_SUITES` with a reason.
